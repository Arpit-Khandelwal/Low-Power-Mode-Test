## Benefits

1. Optimizing website performance: When a user's phone is in low power mode, their device may limit certain features and functions to conserve energy. By detecting low power mode, a website can adjust its performance to minimize energy consumption and improve loading times. This can result in a better user experience for users who are low on battery.

1. Providing battery-saving recommendations: Websites can detect low power mode and provide users with recommendations on how to save battery life. For example, the website could suggest closing other apps or lowering the screen brightness to save battery.

1. Customizing website content: Low power mode can indicate that a user is on the go and may not have much time or energy to spend on the website. In response, the website could prioritize certain content or features to make the user experience more efficient.

1. Avoiding unexpected shutdowns: If a website is resource-intensive and the user's phone is low on battery, the website could cause the phone to unexpectedly shut down. By detecting low power mode, the website can limit its resource usage and prevent this from happening.
